<h1>Mansur Saleem's Portfolio Project</h1>

The goal is to create a Personal portfolio website using React and Bootstrap while keeping inline with modern Responsive Web Design.

A good way to practice my skills as well as a good place to showcase any projects I work on from here on out.

Problems I ran into while making this:

Way too many divs, I spend a lot of time making sure each div was nested correctly and I still missed a few.

Bootstrap 4 vs Bootstrap 5: When looking up Bootstrap issues, I had to keep in mind what version I was on. Otherwise, solutions were not going to work.
